microbiomeDASim: Microbiome Differential Abundance Simulation
================

This package is developed to simulate microbiome data for longitudinal
differential abundance analyses. Microbiome data have a variety of
features that make typical simulation methods inappropriate.

## Installation

To install microbimeDASim use the following R command below

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("williazo/microbiomeDASim")
```

## Simulation Examples

Interactive examples for how to simulate data from a multivariate normal
distribution are available in the `SIMULATION` directory.

To run these interactive examples see instructions for installing a
Jupyter Notebook
[here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), and to
add an R kernel for the notebook see the following reference: [R kernel
for Jupyter NB](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel).

After installing Jupyter and the appopriate kernel you can access an
interactive simulation session of `microbiomeDASim` using
[mvrnorm\_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/williazo/microbiomeDASim/blob/master/SIMULATION/mvrnorm_demo.ipynb)
located in the SIMULATIONS tab and which contains details on the
methodology for setting up the simulations.
